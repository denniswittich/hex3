## About this repository

This repository contains source code of an app, I created in 2017. I decided to make the game 100% free and open-source.

## About the game

The game is a hexognal version of the 'match three' games. Here you have to match three elements of same color in a line to remove them. The game contains several unlockables like special shapes that remove more elements, background animations and game modifications. 

The game can be downloaded in the google play store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.denniswittich.hex3
